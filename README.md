#JS Touch Layer

This project is heavily influenced by the Sencha Touch 1.1.1 gesture framework. The main purpose of this project is to try and get a framework independant of any libraries that will fire events on gestures such as drag, swipe, tap / double tap etc...

CAUTION: this is far from production ready and should be highly tested / modified before being such.

ToDo:

- Add mouse event fallbacks
- Fix bug in Opera Mobile, drag / swipe are not firing.
- Make fully independant of jquery.
- Test on lots of devices
