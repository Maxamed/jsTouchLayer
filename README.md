#JS Touch Layer v0.2.0

JS Touch Layer is a javascript framework that abstracts away the decision of what the gesture is. It will decide for you if a tap is a tap, or a swipe is a swipe. Allowing you to bind your functions to these events without any worry.

JS Touch Layer may be freely distributed under the MIT license.

CAUTION: this is far from production ready and should be highly tested / modified before being such.

ToDo:

- Add gestures: Pinch / Spread
- Test on lots of devices
